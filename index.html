          <h2>I'm Jordan and I love sustainability!</h2>
          <p>My passion is <abbr title="Do It Yourself">DIY</abbr> sustainability. I first becaome interedted in it while building my own backyard brick oven from recycled bricks I was gifted from nearby demoltino site. That was the spark I needed, and since then I have been helping people upgrade their homes to include features that are enviornmentally friendly, help get them at leas a little of the grid, and save them money in the long run. I am avaliable for consulation, planning, and exacution of any sustainable home improvment project. I like my clients to get invloved, so expect to get your hands dirty with me.</p>
          <p>install solar panels? ive done it. Design and build rain water collection? ive done it, set up a composting bin and learn how to use it? Ive done it, Raise Goats? convert your car to run on vegetable oil? grow an indoor vegetable garden? ive done it, Ive done it, Ive done it! whatever project you can think of to improve your home or lifestyle in an enviornmentally conscious way, i probably have experience with it.</p>
          <p>call me to discuss your ideas or project. Or call me to ask what you can do with your current property. ill come out at no charge and give you an honest assessment. In the meantime, explore the rest of this site to see some of my recent projects from planning to completion</p>
